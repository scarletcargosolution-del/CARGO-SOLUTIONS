      I’m reaching out from <strong>Cargo Solutions</strong>, a U.S.-based freight handling

<!-- LOGISTICS MARKET -->
<section>
  <h2>The Logistics & Transportation Market</h2>
  <p>
    The North American logistics market is driven by fast-moving
    supply chains, tight delivery windows, and increasing demand
    for reliable inland transportation. Manufacturers, distributors,
    and retailers rely heavily on trucking to move raw materials,
    finished goods, and time-sensitive freight across state
    and national borders.
  </p>
  <p>
    With rising fuel costs, capacity fluctuations, and strict
    compliance requirements, shippers today need more than just
    a truck — they need a logistics partner who understands
    routing, equipment availability, border procedures, and
    real-time shipment visibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cargo Solutions operates within this dynamic market by
    focusing on operational efficiency, carrier reliability,
    and proactive communication — ensuring freight keeps moving
    even when market conditions are challenging.
